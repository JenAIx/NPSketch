# NPSketch v1.0

**Automated Line Detection for Hand-Drawn Images**

NPSketch is a computer vision application that automatically compares hand-drawn images to reference templates, providing detailed feedback on drawing accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

The goal of this project is to create an automated solution for comparing hand-drawn images --- for example, the "House of Nikolaus" --- to a reference drawing. The system automatically identifies how many lines in the drawing are correct, missing, or misplaced, and provides both numerical and visual feedback.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Line Detection**: Uses OpenCV Hough Transform to detect and extract line features from drawings
- **Smart Comparison**: Compares uploaded drawings to reference templates with configurable tolerance
- **Visual Feedback**: Generates side-by-side visualizations showing matches and differences
- **REST API**: Full-featured FastAPI backend with automatic documentation
- **Modern Web Interface**: Beautiful, responsive web UI with drag & drop upload
- **Database Storage**: SQLite database for storing images, features, and evaluation results
- **Persistent Data**: Volume-mounted data directory for database and visualizations
- **Hot Reload**: Development mode with automatic code reloading

### Communication Flow

```
Browser → nginx (Port 80) → Static HTML files (webapp/)
        ↓
        JavaScript → /api/* → nginx → FastAPI (Port 8000)
        ↓
        Response with JSON data
```

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Environment and Setup

The system uses:
- **FastAPI** for creating the REST API
- **OpenCV** for image processing and line detection
- **scikit-image** for advanced image registration and morphological operations
- **SQLite** for database storage and metadata management
- **Nginx** as reverse proxy and static file server

### 2. Reference Image Definition (Manual)

**NPSketch uses a manual, interactive approach for defining reference features:**

On first startup:
1. The system detects that no reference image is initialized
2. The webapp displays only the "Reference Image" option
3. The user opens the **Reference Editor** (`reference.html`)

**Manual Line Definition:**
- The reference image is displayed at 256×256 pixels
- User clicks two points on the image to define a line
- Each line is automatically categorized as:
  - **Horizontal** (angle 0° ± 10°)
  - **Vertical** (angle 90° ± 10°)
  - **Diagonal** (45°, 135°, 60°, 120°, etc.)
- Lines are color-coded and displayed as an overlay
- Lines can be deleted individually from the feature list
- Once all lines are defined, they are stored in the database

**Why Manual Definition?**
- 100% accuracy for ground truth (no detection errors)
- Full control over what constitutes a "correct" line
- Works for any drawing, regardless of complexity
- Simple and intuitive for non-technical users

### 3. Test Image Creation

**NPSketch includes a powerful test image creator** (`draw_testimage.html`):

**Drawing Tools:**
- 256×256 pixel canvas (matches reference resolution)
- Adjustable brush size (1-10px)
- Draw and erase modes
- Clear all functionality
- **Rotation buttons** (±10°) to create variations

**Manual Scoring:**
- User manually scores the drawing:
  - **Correct Lines**: How many reference lines are present
  - **Missing Lines**: Auto-calculated (reference_total - correct)
  - **Extra Lines**: Additional lines not in reference
- This creates ground truth data for testing the detection algorithm

**Test Image Management:**
- All test images are listed with their scores
- Click to load and edit
- Update existing or save as new
- Delete unwanted test images
- Automatic timestamp-based naming

**Why Manual Test Images?**
- Creates a labeled dataset for algorithm validation
- Tests edge cases (rotations, missing lines, extra strokes)
- Measures "Prediction Accuracy" (expected vs actual detection)

### 4. Image Upload & Processing (3-Step Workflow)

**NPSketch provides an intuitive 3-step workflow for image upload and processing:**

**STEP 1: Upload & Auto-Normalization (Backend)**
When you upload an image via `upload.html`:
1. **Auto-Crop**: Removes white space around the drawing
2. **Scale to Fit**: Scales object to fill 256×256 canvas (maintains aspect ratio using `min(height_ratio, width_ratio)`)
3. **Center**: Places scaled drawing centered on white 256×256 canvas
4. **Display**: Shows normalized image immediately in the workspace

**STEP 2: Manual Adjustments (Frontend)**
After upload, you can fine-tune the image interactively:
- **Scale Control** (50-300%): Adjust image size with slider
- **Rotation Control** (-180° to +180°): Rotate with slider or ±10° buttons
- **Translation Controls**: Move image with arrow buttons (X/Y in pixels)
- **Overlay Mode**: Toggle to see your drawing overlaid on reference
- All adjustments are applied in real-time on the canvas

**STEP 3: Auto Match (Optional, Backend)**
If "Apply Auto Match after upload" is checked (default):
- **Image Registration**: Automatically aligns your drawing to the reference
  - Uses ECC or feature-based registration (ORB, RANSAC)
  - Applies optimal translation, rotation, and scale
  - Configurable motion type (Translation/Euclidean/Similarity/Affine)
  - Limited to ±30° rotation for natural drawings
- **Line Thinning**: Skeletonizes lines to 1px thickness for consistent detection
- Manual transformations are reset after auto match completes

**STEP 4: Analysis & Evaluation**
Click "Analyze Drawing" to:
- Extract line features from your processed drawing
- Compare detected lines to reference features
- Calculate accuracy metrics (correct, missing, extra lines)
- Generate side-by-side visualization
- Store results in database
- Show **Success Banner** with quick link to evaluations page

**Stage 2: Line Detection (Iterative with Pixel Subtraction)**
1. **Binary Threshold**: Strong black/white separation (threshold=127)
2. **Iterative Detection** (up to 20 iterations):
   - **Multi-Pass Strategy**:
     - Pass 1 (Iter 1-10): Strict threshold (18), longer lines (35px)
     - Pass 2 (Iter 11-20): Relaxed threshold (10), shorter lines (25px)
   - **Longest-First**: Sorts detected lines by length, picks longest
   - **Overlap Check**: Rejects duplicates using angle (±8°) and position (±25px)
   - **Special Handling**: Crossing lines (X pattern) are NOT considered duplicates if angle difference is 80-100°
   - **Pixel Subtraction**:
     - Draws detected line on mask with 8px buffer
     - **Dilates** mask with 5×5 ellipse kernel (expands by 2-3px)
     - **Subtracts** dilated region from image
     - This removes the line completely, preventing re-detection
   - Stops when no more lines found or 12 lines detected
3. **Final Filter**: Removes lines shorter than 30px (noise reduction)

**Why This Approach?**
- Iterative detection finds all lines systematically
- Pixel subtraction eliminates duplicates naturally
- Dilate ensures complete removal (no artifacts)
- Multi-pass catches both strong and weak lines
- Crossing lines are properly handled

### 5. Comparison & Evaluation (Hungarian Algorithm)

**NPSketch uses the Hungarian Algorithm for optimal line matching:**

**Line Similarity Calculation:**
For each pair of detected and reference lines, calculate:
1. **Position Distance**: Euclidean distance between line midpoints
   - Normalized by tolerance (default: 120px)
2. **Angle Difference**: Angular difference in degrees
   - Normalized to 0-90° range (lines have no direction)
   - Normalized by tolerance (default: 50°)
3. **Length Ratio**: Relative length difference
   - Calculated as: `|len1 - len2| / max(len1, len2)`
   - Normalized by tolerance (default: 0.8 or 80%)
4. **Combined Similarity**: Weighted average
   - Position: 40%, Angle: 30%, Length: 30%

**Optimal Matching (Hungarian Algorithm):**
- Creates a cost matrix (1 - similarity for all pairs)
- Uses `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` for optimal bipartite matching
- Ensures best global assignment (not greedy)
- Filters matches by similarity threshold (default: 0.5)

**Metrics Calculated:**
- **Correct Lines**: Number of matched pairs (similarity ≥ threshold)
- **Missing Lines**: Reference lines with no match
- **Extra Lines**: Detected lines >30px with no match (filters noise)
- **Reference Match Score**: `correct_lines / total_reference_lines`

**Accuracy Calculation:**
```python
if missing == 0:
    accuracy = 100%
else:
    # Penalize: each extra line cancels one correct line
    adjusted_correct = max(0, correct - extra)
    accuracy = adjusted_correct / total_reference_lines
```

**Why Hungarian Algorithm?**
- Guarantees optimal matching (no local optima)
- Fairer than greedy algorithms
- Standard approach in computer vision
- Better handles ambiguous cases

### 6. Automated Testing & Validation

**Run Tests Page** (`run_test.html`):
- Displays count of available test images
- Configurable settings:
  - **Image Registration**: Enable/disable, motion type (Translation/Euclidean/Similarity/Affine)
  - **Line Matching Tolerances**: Position, angle, length
  - **Max Rotation**: Limit for registration search
- **Runs all test images** through the pipeline
- Compares **Expected vs Actual** detection results

**Two Key Metrics:**
1. **Reference Match**: How well detected lines match the reference (like normal evaluation)
2. **Test Rating** (Prediction Accuracy): How well actual detection matches expected scores
   - Perfect when detected lines match user's manual scoring
   - Measures algorithm reliability

**Test Results Display:**
- Overall statistics (average Test Rating, perfect tests, etc.)
- Individual results (collapsed/expandable)
- Side-by-side visualization: Original → Registered → Reference
- Shows: Expected (user), Actual (detected), Difference

### 7. Visualization and Debugging

Each processed image generates a 3-panel visualization:

**Panel 1: Original**
- Shows the uploaded/test image as-is

**Panel 2: Registered**
- Shows the image after registration (if enabled)
- Displays transformation info (rotation, scale, translation)
- Detected lines color-coded:
  - 🟢 **Green**: Matched lines (in both detected and reference)
  - 🔵 **Blue**: Extra lines (detected but not in reference)

**Panel 3: Reference**
- Shows the reference image with manually defined lines
- Reference lines color-coded:
  - 🟢 **Green**: Matched lines (found in detection)
  - 🔴 **Red**: Missing lines (not detected)

**Registration Info:**
- Translation (X/Y in pixels)
- Rotation (degrees)
- Scale factor (e.g., 1.77x)
- Overlap score (quality metric)

Visualizations are stored in `data/visualizations/` and accessible through the API.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Line Detection Parameters (Iterative Method)

Edit `api/image_processing/line_detector.py`:

```python
LineDetector(
    rho=1.0,                # Distance resolution (pixels)
    theta=np.pi/180,        # Angle resolution (radians)
    threshold=18,           # Base threshold (Pass 1: strict)
    min_line_length=35,     # Initial min length (Pass 1)
    max_line_gap=35,        # Max gap between segments
    final_min_length=30     # Final filter (removes short artifacts)
)
```

**Multi-Pass Strategy:**
- **Pass 1** (Iterations 1-10): `threshold=15`, `min_line_length=35px` (strong lines)
- **Pass 2** (Iterations 11-20): `threshold=10`, `min_line_length=25px` (weak lines)

**Overlap Detection:**
- `angle_threshold=8.0°` (lines with similar angles)
- `position_threshold=25.0px` (lines at similar positions)
- Special case: 80-100° difference = crossing lines (both kept)

### Image Registration Parameters

Edit `api/image_processing/image_registration.py` or configure via UI:

```python
ImageRegistration(
    max_rotation_degrees=30,    # Search range for rotation
    rotation_step=3,            # Angular resolution
    scale_range=(0.75, 1.30),   # Scale search range
    scale_step=0.05,            # Scale resolution
    translation_range=(-10, 10), # X/Y search range
    translation_step=5          # Translation resolution
)
```

**Pre-Scaling:**
- Calculates `min(height_ratio, width_ratio)` to prevent clipping
- Clips to `0.5-2.5x` range
- Centers result on white canvas

**Thinning (Skeletonization):**
- Applied if `total_scale > 1.1x`
- Uses `skimage.morphology.skeletonize` for 1-pixel lines
- Includes Gaussian smoothing for anti-aliasing

### Comparison Tolerance (Hungarian Algorithm)

Edit `api/image_processing/comparator.py` or configure via UI:

```python
LineComparator(
    position_tolerance=120.0,   # Max position difference (pixels)
    angle_tolerance=50.0,       # Max angle difference (degrees)
    length_tolerance=0.8,       # Max length difference (ratio)
    similarity_threshold=0.5    # Min similarity for match
)
```

**Optimized Values:**
- These values were determined through automated grid search testing
- Balance between precision and recall
- Configurable in real-time via Run Tests page
